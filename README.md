======

This directory should be placed here: %A_MyDocuments%\AutoHotkey\Lib\  ; User library.
To see where that is, you can create a short .ahk script that runs MsgBox, %A_MyDocuments%\AutoHotkey\Lib\

From https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Functions.htm#lib

Libraries of Functions: Standard Library and User Library [v1.0.47+]
A script may call a function in an external file without having to use #Include. For this to work, a file of the same name as the function must exist in one of the following library directories:

%A_ScriptDir%\Lib\  ; Local library - requires [v1.0.90+].
%A_MyDocuments%\AutoHotkey\Lib\  ; User library.
directory-of-the-currently-running-AutoHotkey.exe\Lib\  ; Standard library.
